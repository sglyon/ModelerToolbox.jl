```julia
init_jld(x, [force=false])
```

Initialize the jld_file for objects of type `typeof(x)`. This creates the file
(if needed) and ensures that a `groups` dataset exists and constructs a group
for the instance `x`.

If `force` is `true` any existing file is overwritten and the above operations
are performed.

This should only be called by users when they want to completely reconstruct
the jld file.
